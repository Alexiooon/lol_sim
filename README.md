**Note: This is extremely early in development. It is lacking in most features, much of which I plan to add. If you have any suggestions, feel free to send them my way :)**

# Introduction
This is a tool  to simulate different scenarios in League of Legends, which include:
- DPS calculations
- 1v1/2v2 scenarios
- More to come...

It's entirely written in Python, and works as a scripting interface. It defines an event loop, which different characters/champions with selected stats can be feeded into, to then simulate or "play out" a scenario.
A scenario may be just testing its DPS versus a defined target, or a duel to estimate who comes out on top.
